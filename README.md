### Introduction

This capstone project should take a maximum of 7 days.Therefore as a learner, you need to plan yourself well.

### Web Application Project

You are required to create an authentication system wherein a user can log in to see the next page of the site. The credentials when a user creates a new account get stored in a database, open source your project in any version  control system of your choice, host it in any web hosting service provider and write a blog post/article  to document  it.

**You final application/system must have all the features a login authentication system should have, these features  are:** 

1. Users can log in only if their credentials are present in the database.
 
2. Without logging in, the user cannot go to the next page, even using that particular page's routes.
 
3. When logged in, the user can go to other pages using routes.
 
4. After clicking on logout, the user cannot go to the next page again using routes.

5. If the email or username already exists in the database, the user will not create the account.

Remember to open source your project in any version control system of your choice and write a blog post/article to document it.


### Data Science Project


Retail industry is a front-runner in the large scale employment of data science. Areas such as product placement, inventory management and customization
of offers, are sought to improve constantly through the application of data science. [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/) is one such retailer.

This [Walmart data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting) provides information on the historical sales data of 45 stores of Walmart, each of which having various departments,you are reaquired 
to predict the department-wise sales of each store using the historical data spanning across 143 weeks.

Walmart is also known for conducting promotional markdown events before major holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Super Bowl among others. 
The difference between the weightage given to the data of regular weeks and the weeks including holiday seasons, coupled with unavailability of complete historical data, adds another level of difficulty of factoring the effects of the markdowns on the sales during the holiday weeks. This is a regression analysis problem.

### Objective:

- Predict the sales across various departments in each store.

- Predict the effect of markdowns on the sales during the holiday seasons.

This should be done at an individual level individually.

ALL THE BEST and SUCCESS.
